title: A Scarf
author: By Doreen St. Félix
content: The promise of black visibility has always been twisted. Mechanisms of seeing are also mechanisms of intruding, policing, controlling. But Hyphen-Labs, a collective of women technologists of color, has developed an ingenious workaround—a scarf that occludes the wearer’s face, but only selectively. To the human eye, the scarf adorns; to a computer’s eye, it obscures, because of a camouflage pattern called HyperFace printed on the fabric. HyperFace, which was developed by the designer Adam Harvey, is a mess of pixelated blotches, out of which emerge twelve hundred shapes that are almost like faces, but not quite. This jumble of visual data overloads facial-recognition algorithms.
